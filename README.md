<!-- Yes, it looks like your setup was successful! Here's why:

PostgreSQL Logs:

The PostgreSQL container initialized correctly, created the database, and successfully started.
The logs indicate that PostgreSQL has started and is ready to accept connections (database system is ready to accept connections).
The database system was shut down and restarted, but this is typical behavior after Docker container initialization.
pgAdmin Logs:

The pgAdmin container also started successfully (pgAdmin 4 - Application Initialisation and Listening at: http://[::]:6000).
It’s ready and listening for requests at port 6000 inside the container, but since you mapped it to port 7100 on your local machine, you’ll be able to access it at http://localhost:7100.
Next Steps:
Access pgAdmin:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:7100.
Use the credentials from your .env file to log in to pgAdmin:
Email: sogo.oyerinde@gmail.com
Password: sogoyayo_93
Add PostgreSQL Server in pgAdmin: Once logged in to pgAdmin, you need to manually add the PostgreSQL server in pgAdmin:

Right-click on Servers in the left sidebar and select Create > Server.
In the General tab, set a name for the server (e.g., "My PostgreSQL").
Under the Connection tab, fill in:
Host: postgresdb (this is the service name you gave to the PostgreSQL container in docker-compose.yml)
Port: 5432
Username: root
Password: tonyyayo
Test Database Connection:

Once pgAdmin connects to the PostgreSQL server, you can test by querying your dongi database or checking its structure.
Check for Errors: If there are any issues, you can check the logs again with:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs
This will give you more details if something isn't working as expected.

Conclusion:
It looks like everything is running fine! Your PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin containers are up and running, and you should be able to access and manage the database via pgAdmin at http://localhost:7100. You can also connect your backend code to the database using the environment variables defined in your .env file -->




<!-- 
The host name in pgAdmin must match the service name you specified for the PostgreSQL container in your docker-compose.yml file. This is because Docker Compose sets up an internal network where services can communicate with each other using their service names as hostnames.

Why postgresdb is Used:
In your docker-compose.yml file, the PostgreSQL service is defined as follows:

yaml
Copy code
services:
  postgresdb:
    container_name: postgrescontainer
    image: postgres:16.1
    # other configurations


The service name here is postgresdb, which means other services within the same Docker Compose network (including pgAdmin) can reach the PostgreSQL container using postgresdb as the hostname.

So:
The hostname in pgAdmin must be postgresdb (the service name).
You cannot use localhost, 127.0.0.1, or any arbitrary name in place of postgresdb because these names would refer to your host machine (not the container within Docker's internal network).
Example:
In pgAdmin, when creating the server connection, the host should be postgresdb because that is how the PostgreSQL container can be identified inside the Docker network.
In pgAdmin settings:
Host: postgresdb (Docker Compose service name for PostgreSQL)
Port: 5432
Username: root (as per your environment variables)
Password: tonyyayo (as per your environment variables)
Summary:
The service name in Docker Compose acts as the hostname for containers to communicate with each other, so it must match the service name you define in docker-compose.yml. You can give it any name you want, but once you set it, make sure to use that name when configuring connections between containers or in pgAdmin. -->
